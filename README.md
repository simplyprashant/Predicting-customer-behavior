# Predicting Customer behavior

Customers are more empowered than ever because they have access to a wealth of information at their fingertips. Being reactive in today's world is not ideal as the customer has a lot of options to choose from. In this project, we will analyze customer booking data to see if we can identify any underlying pattern and use this to see which factors are important to get a successful booking.
